            <p>The roof, ceiling and floors are not able to behave as horizontal diaphragms. This might be because the diaphragms are weak. Alternatively, they might not be not connected strongly enough to the walls they are expected to support or the vertical structure into which they are expected to transfer seismic inertia forces.</p>
