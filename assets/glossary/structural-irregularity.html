            <p><span>Structural irregularity is a feature of a building's structural  arrangement, such as one storey significantly higher than other  storeys, an irregular building shape or <span>a </span>change of structural system or material, that produces a known vulnerability during an earthquake. The user can choose <span>a </span>maximum of two vertical and two plan  irregularities for a building. However, if a building has two irregularities of the same type (plan/vertical), the user needs to prioritize them by identifying the primary irregularity first and the secondary irregularity next. <span> </span></span></p>
