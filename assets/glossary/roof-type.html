<p>The roof type is the structural system that supports the roof cladding. Roof types are grouped according to material and method of construction. Do not include materials that are non-structural or that are not part of the roof structure. In many cases roof structures are overlaid with roofing or cladding such as lightweight metal sheet, but it is the structure under that overlay material that should be listed as the roof type.</p>
