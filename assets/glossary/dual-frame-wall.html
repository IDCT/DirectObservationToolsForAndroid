<p>The lateral load-resisting structure comprises of moment frames and shear walls acting together in the same direction. Due to the slenderness of the walls the structural system cannot be classified as a Wall system, yet the walls may have a positive effect on the performance of the frames such as by preventing a soft storey collapse. The shear walls are usually solid (not perforated by openings) and they can be found around the stairwell, around the elevator shafts and/or at the perimeter of the building. The very slender walls of a dual frame-wall system may or may not have been designed for the level of earthquake forces that could be imposed upon them.</p>
