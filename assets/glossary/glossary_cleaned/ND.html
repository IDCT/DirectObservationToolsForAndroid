            <p>Steel members and steel reinforcing are not designed nor constructed to undergo plastic deformation before failure under earthquake loads. In the event of over-load during an earthquake structural members are expected to suffer brittle failure.</p>
<p>For example, moment frames with weak columns and strong beams are non-ductile because once the columns are damaged they usually are unable to resist gravity loads.  Reinforced concrete frames will also be classified as non-ductile if beam and column ties have 90 degree rather than 135 degree hooks, and if there is insufficient quantity and spacing of shear reinforcement to prevent shear failure before flexural failure.</p>
