<p>Grade is the level of the ground at the perimeter of the building. This attribute records the height of the <a href="ground-floor.html" class="internal-link">ground floor</a> level of the building above grade. <br><br>The height of ground floor level above grade can be recorded as an exact number, or as a range, or as an approximate number. It can also be recorded as unknown. <br><br>Grade is usually somewhat lower than the ground floor level, and this information is relevant for flood hazard and foundation seismic performance.</p>
