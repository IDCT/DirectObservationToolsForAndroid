            <p>A building such as with a L- or U- shaped plan where two wings may vibrate out-of-phase, leading to large horizontal deformations at their ends and or tearing of floor diaphragms.</p>
<p>If the plan setback is at least 15% of the larger dimension of the plan dimension parallel to the setback, then the setback is considered to form a re-entrant corner.</p>

<p>A building with re-entrant corner shown to the left. This configuration that results in both stress concentration and torsion.  Movement of the wings of the building results in a concentration of stress at the notch, and the asymmetry of the building results in torsion. The photo shows an L- shaped hotel building that has torn itself apart at the notch (C. Arnold)</p>
