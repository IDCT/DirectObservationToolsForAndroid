            Wooden roof structure supporting a heavy flat or domed roof

		<div class="" id="parent-fieldname-definition">
            <p>Wooden beams or trusses and joists, supporting heavy roof infill. Examples include a wooden roof with a layer of earth covered by clay roof tiles, found in high precipitation regions around the world. Another example of heavy covering is stone tiles, which are used for roofing.</p>
<p>Heavy roof infills are made from mixture of clay, straw and tamped earth. New layers are added annually to the roof as a protection against rain and snow percolation. These are predominantly single-storey buildings and are found in rural areas of Eastern Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, China, as well as in the Andean highlands and other regions.</p>
