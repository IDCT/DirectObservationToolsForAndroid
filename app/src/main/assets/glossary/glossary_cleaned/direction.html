<p>The Direction attribute is intended to identify two principal horizontal directions of the building plan. It is possible to specify different <a href="lateral-load-resisting-system.html" class="internal-link"><span class="internal-link">Lateral Load-Resisting System</span></a> (LLRS) and the corresponding <a href="material-of-the-lateral-load-resisting-system.html" class="internal-link">Material of the Lateral Load-Resisting System </a>in two directions called Direction X and Direction Y; these systems are often referred to as Hybrid Systems or Mixed Systems. Where it is possible to specify directions, <a href="direction-x.html" class="internal-link">Direction X</a> is parallel to street, and <a href="direction-y.html" class="internal-link">Direction Y</a> is perpendicular (orthogonal) to street. In some cases, it is not possible to identify Direction X and Direction Y - thus the user can select <a href="unspecified-direction--d99.html" class="internal-link">Unspecified Direction</a>.</p>
<p>Note that other types of hybrid systems can be described by the <a href="hybrid-lateral-load-resisting-system--lh.html" class="internal-link">Hybrid Lateral Load-Resisting System</a> attribute, which should be applied in one of the  following cases: a) there is more than one LLRS in the building, but there is no clear distinction between LLRSs in directions X and Y, or b) there is only one LLRS, but two or more materials of the LLRS  are used in different portions of the building.</p>

<p>A building showing possible orientation for Directions X and Y</p>
<p align="left"><b>EXAMPLE 1: </b>A building has two different LLRSs: reinforced concrete flat plate (slab and column system) parallel to street, and reinforced concrete wall system perpendicular to street, as shown below. In this case, Direction X (parallel to street) is associated with a flat plate system (LFLS) (see Section 2), and Direction Y (perpendicular to street) is associated with a wall system (LWAL) (see Section 1).</p>

<p align="left">EXAMPLE 2: The Direction attribute can be used to describe a hybrid LLRS from  Chile, with reinforced concrete frames in longitudinal  direction (Direction X) and confined masonry in transverse  direction (Direction Y). It is assumed that Direction X (parellel to  street) is longitudinal direction because entrance to individual housing  units is in that direction (M. O. Moroni Yadlin).</p>

<p align="left">EXAMPLE 3: The Direction attribute can be used to describe a hybrid system from  Chile, where confined masonry is used in one direction and reinforced  concrete shear walls in other direction (Moroni, Gomez, and Astroza, <a class="external-link" href="http://www.world-housing.net/whereport1view.php?id=100036">World Housing Encyclopedia Report 8</a>). The photo shows an earthquake-damaged building, and the drawing shows a typical building plan (not related to the building shown on the photo).</p>
