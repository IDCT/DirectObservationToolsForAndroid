<p>The floor type is the structural system of the floor. Floor types are grouped according to material and methods of construction. Do not include materials that are non-structural or that are not part of the floor structure. In many cases floor structures are overlaid with timber flooring or tiles etc., but it is the structure under that overlay material that should be listed as the floor type.</p>
