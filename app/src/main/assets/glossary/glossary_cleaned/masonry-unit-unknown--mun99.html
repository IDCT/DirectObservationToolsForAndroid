<p>It is clear that the structural material is masonry, but the type of masonry is unknown. The build-up of the wall may be hidden, as in the case of a plastered wall, or information about it is unavailable.</p>

<p>Walls in masonry buildings are usually covered by plaster at the exterior and it is difficult to identify type of masonry unit used in such cases - like in the case of the masonry building in Constitution, Chile shown in the top photo; however, a closer inspection of the walls and the building interior revealed the adobe construction, as shown in the bottom photo (S. Brzev)</p>

<p>This is likely a masonry building, but the type of masonry unit is not known, Halifax, Canada (S. Brzev)</p>
