<p>The building is used for commercial or retail at the ground floor, with residential  or office accommodation above. Choose this attribute if the proportion of the commercial and residential occupancies are approximately equal. Otherwise for mixed occupancy choose the dominant occupancy. For example, choose ‘mixed occupancy’ for a two story building with a single-family dwelling above a shop, but choose multi-family dwelling for a ten-story apartment building with shops at ground floor.</p>
