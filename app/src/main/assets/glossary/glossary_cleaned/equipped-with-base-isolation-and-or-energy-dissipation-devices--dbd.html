<p>The building is equipped with base isolation and/or energy dissipation devices; this is an alternative to conventional seismic design approach, where buildings are designed for ductile performance. Base isolation reduces seismic effects in a building by “decoupling” it from the ground. This is achieved by installing isolation devices (isolators), usually at the base level of a building. In some cases, isolation devices are provided above the base. Base isolation devices are often not visible from the building exterior.</p>
<p>Energy dissipation devices (often called seismic dampers) reduce seismic effects in a building by providing supplemental damping. Energy dissipation devices act in a similar manner like shock absorbers (brakes) in cars. There are several types of devices and they are more often visible (particularly in retrofitted buildings) and look similar to diagonal steel braces.</p>
