<p>A Vertical Irregularity, not defined as any of the other Vertical Irregularity definitions in this table, that is likely to adversely affect the earthquake performance of the building.</p>
<p>Examples include weight (mass) irregularity where the weight of one floor is greater than 150% of an adjacent floor, and in-plane discontinuity where an in plane-offset of a vertical lateral load-resisting system causes greater overturning demands on the supporting structure. An example is where, say a braced frame at ground level consists of two bays, but there are three bays above. Other vertical irregularities include non-concentric column-beam joints.</p>
