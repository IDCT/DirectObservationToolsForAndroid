The Modified EMS-98 form provided here allows the capture of the most important data from the full EMS-98 assessment form as well as
provision for associating Geo-tagged images of buildings to the data gathered.

The Settings Menu allows the user to set up preferences common to all forms for a particular survey: Earthquake name, Surveyor name, Date and Survey name.
These settings must be entered to allow the survey to proceed.

By using the back and forward buttons on each screen users can progress through the form or choose to return to a previous page to edit the content. 

Upon completion of a form a new survey can be initiated or the user can choose to return to the Main Menu. Both options will clear any data gathered by the
user. 

The application stores gathered data as a ".txt" file. The filename is automatically generated by the application and takes the form of

*Earthquake name_Surveyor name_Survey name_Date_Time.txt*

The date and time are automatically accessed from the phone by the app. This automatic file name system allows the data to be easily archived and identified at a later date.

The image captured is is stored as "*.jpeg" of the same name. 

Please send any suggestions or report any bugs to earthquake.developer@gmail.com.
